<h1>Observable hierarchical queues</h1>

<p>This repo contains files that are being used to understand the game theoretical situations that arise in hierarchical queues. There are 2 basic methodologies that are used:</p>

<ul>
<li>Hybrid ABS-DES simulation</li>
<li>Markov Decision Process (although this is proving quite tricky)</li>
</ul>

<p><p>The simulation model was developed during an undergraduate research project. <a href="https://plus.google.com/104243854554833157722/posts">Jason Young</a> developed most of the code. He presented this work at OR54, take a look at his talk <a href="http://youtu.be/2lOvhcy3Rgk" title="Sorry for the terrible sound quality">here</a>.</p>
